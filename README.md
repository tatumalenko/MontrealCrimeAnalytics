Python 3.7+ is required to run the app. Once you have your Python environment set up, install the necessary dependencies by entering:
```shell
$ pip install requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, simply run the app by entering:
```shell
$ python app.py
```

Then click anywhere on the graph to pick a start and end point for the algorithm to find the optimal path using A*.

You can also change the width and threshold percent in the text boxes in the bottom left corner of the window.

See the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies required.
